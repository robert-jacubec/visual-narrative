                    Another parameter that is positively correlated with house prices is the <b>house size</b> itself. Homes have become <br/>
                    larger and larger over time. Thus, the house price will be affect by increased house size. <br/>
                    Americans have been demanding larger and larger homes. So, house builders have been building larger <br/>
                    and larger homes to meet the demand of consumers. Thus, house prices also increased to reflect 
                    <br/> the increasing sizes of homes.
